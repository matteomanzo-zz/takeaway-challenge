Take Away Challenge
===================

Tasks
-----
* Write a Takeaway program.
* Implement the following functionality:

  - list of dishes with prices.
  - placing the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not
  correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  - The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. Itâ€™s free.
  - Use twilio-ruby gem to access the API.
  - Use a Gemfile to manage your gems.
  - Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run.
  - However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.

The CUSTOMER *place* the ORDER (quantity and total of the MENU's dishes).
As soon as the SHOP *checks* the total, it will *send* a TEXT to the CUSTOMER saying that the ORDER was successfully *taken* and it will be *delivered* in one hour.
If the total doesn't match with the sum of the prices, an error will raise.
